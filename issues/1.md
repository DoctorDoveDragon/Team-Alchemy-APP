# Tabs are showing as null in the frontend

**Description:**
Tabs in the UI are not rendering correctly and are showing up as `null`. This might be happening due to:
- API response returning `null` values for tab data
- Incorrect tab data structure or mapping in a React component (`frontend/src/components`)
- State initialization issue (e.g., `useState(null)` instead of an empty array)
- Failing data fetch (API/network error, incorrect endpoint)

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to the page where tabs should be rendered.
2. Observe that no tabs appear, or `null` is shown.

**Expected Result:**
Tabs should display correctly as clickable UI elements with appropriate labels.

**Actual Result:**
Tabs section is blank or shows `null`.

**Additional context:**
- Please specify which tab component and which page is impacted if possible.
- Provide console/browser error logs if available.
